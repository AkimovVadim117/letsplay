# Let`s play!
## Hello! I am __Vadim Akimov__, a beginner front-end developer.
I am 18 years old, I live in Barnaul, and in this project I would like to show my JavaScript code.<br>
This is my __third__ and __oldest__ project, which I did for a week, but little by little.<br>

### So far there are only 3 games:
- *__Snake__*;<br>
- *__Tic-tac-toe__*;<br>
- *__Rock-Paper-Scissors__*;<br>

### I plan to add:
- *__A system for saving achievement statistics in existing games (or in future tools / applications)$__*<br>
- *__Various text polls, quizzes, crosswords__*;<br>
- *__Tools__* (Various calculators, Random number-generator, etc.);<br>
- *__2D platformer__*;<br>

_Over time, I will supplement my project with different applications._<br>

At the beginning of development, I encountered various problems, but I tried to solve them and it worked out.<br>
__If there is a problem - I do not leave it, but work on it.__
